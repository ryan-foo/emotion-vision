This was a hardware hack our team completed for Hack and Roll 2020, Singapore's largest student-run hackathon with over 560 participants and 140 teams. Our team consisted of Ryan Foo, Chia Yong Kang, Vishnu Sarath, and Kerf Chang. Two of our teammates were first-time hackers, and all of us were first-time hardware hackers.

Our smart glasses, SEENSE, allow the visually impaired to recognise other peopleâ€™s emotions through computer vision, emotion recognition and audio feedback. This will allow them to improve their interpersonal relationships with their family and friends by providing them a technologically assistive avenue to enable understand the world around them.

We emerged in the 'Top 8' category for this hack.
