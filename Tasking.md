## User Research

### Research on the market size for the blind, how many people will we be helping with this solution? Is this a useful solution? Why or why not?

### Conduct usability testing, smoothen the flow of someone putting them on

### Network and share our solution amongst the different hackers + judges, ask them for feedback

## Research

### Research into encoding for signals (given an emotion, how do I process that into feedback for the user?)

### Research into
