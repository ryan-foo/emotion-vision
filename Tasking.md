# Tasks that need to be accomplished

## Hardware

### Research Hardware components required for solution

Which hardware components do we need?
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (Preferably)
	- Possible to have it purely battery operated?
	- It is bluetooth, wifi
- Camera Module (standard version)
- Camera Module ribbon for the Zero

- Desktop
- Keyboard
- Mouse

- Raspberry Pi 4 Kit
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- Raspberry Pi bluetooth module


### Source Hardware components required for solution

### Lias with MLH to pick up and get the required components

### Establish connection between Android phone and Raspberry Pi

### Establish connection between Camera and Raspberry Pi

### Establish connection between button and camera

## Software

### Get Azure API running on the Android Phone

### Get Azure API running on the Raspberry Pi

### Write pre-processing program

### Write post-processing program

### How will we activate the camera?

## User Research

### Research on the market size for the blind, how many people will we be helping with this solution? Is this a useful solution? Why or why not?

### How can we generate revenue? Who can we partner with for technologies // Microsoft technology etc?

###

### UI/UX. Is there an application? There should be an app to set up?

### Blind people cannot find their glasses, how will they find it? Beeping

### Conduct usability testing, smoothen the flow of someone putting them on

### Network and share our solution amongst the different hackers + judges, ask them for feedback

## Research

### Research into encoding for signals (given an emotion, how do I process that into feedback for the user?)

### Research into the emotions that people care about, happiness, sadness, fear, anger, neutral

### Research into Bluetooth communication for Raspberry Pi
